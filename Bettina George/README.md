# Bettina George — Personal Portfolio

## 🚧 Under Construction

This portfolio is actively being rebuilt. Content and layout may change frequently.

A clean, single-page portfolio that highlights my work, skills, coursework, and experience.  
Originally scaffolded from the open-source **Fimbo** template (credit below) and then **heavily customized**—new layout, components, theme, and interactions.

**Live site:** _add your URL here_  
**Stack:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · jQuery · Animate.css · Font Awesome · Google Fonts · Particles.js

## Template Credit

This site was originally scaffolded from the open-source **Fimbo** portfolio template by [@imfunniee](https://github.com/imfunniee).
Repository: <https://github.com/imfunniee/fimbo> · Demo: <https://imfunniee.github.io/fimbo>

I’ve **significantly modified** the template, including (but not limited to):

- New color system, typography, and page layout
- Rebuilt project cards and the coursework pill layout
- 3D rotating tech-stack orbs with hover tooltips and animations
- Experience timeline with center rail and alternating cards
- Accessibility and interaction improvements (focus states, reduced motion, contrast)
- New sections and content structure
